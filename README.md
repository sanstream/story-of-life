# Story Of Life

> Like a zero player game, but with species, competition and evolution.

The game starts with:
- Autothropes, that are comsumed by
- Herbivores, that are comsumed by
- Carnivores

Effectively creating an eco system.

Futhermore each organism requires resources to survive and reproduce, because each organism has a limited lifespan.

Those are the basic rules. Let the game begin!
